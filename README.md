# AI University Content Analysis

## Project Overview
This research project analyzes AI-oriented content published on official university websites.
The study focuses on content structure, temporal dynamics, institutional profiles, and language representation,
with particular attention to the presence of the Kazakh language in AI-related materials.

## Data
The dataset consists of university website pages containing AI-related content.
For each page, the following attributes were analyzed:
- publication year
- content type
- text volume
- language
- institutional affiliation

Special methodological attention is given to detecting Kazakh language content,
including cases where it is implicitly embedded in Cyrillic texts
automatically classified as Russian.

## Methodology
The analysis combines:
- web content analysis of university websites
- NLP-based language detection with Kazakh-specific heuristics
- classification of AI content by type
- dynamic and comparative institutional analysis

## Key Findings
- AI-related content is predominantly news- and education-oriented
- Research and strategy-driven AI content is limited
- A sharp increase in AI publications is observed in the 2020s
- Kazakh language content exists but is often not institutionally formalized
  as a separate language version on university websites

## Technologies
Python, pandas, matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

## Status
Research project / academic portfolio
